# Tableau-Citibike
## Module 18 Challenge Datavis Bootcamp
Using Tableau to generate a regular report for city officials looking to publicize and improve the New York Citi Bike Program.

## **Overview of the Analysis**
This analysis aims to Tableau to determine key metrics about the New York Citi Bike Program and generate visuals which can best provide answers to city officials.<br/>

## **Tableau Presentation**
Here is an interactive Dashboard for you to explore my data. <br/>

<details><summary>Our Task</Summary>

1. Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods. <br/>
    * The following are questions you may wish to answer. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative! <br/>
        *How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period? <br/>
        *By what percentage has total ridership grown? <br/>
        *How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? <br/>
        *What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months? <br/>
        *What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months? <br/>
        *Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations? <br/>
        *Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why? <br/>
        *Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why? <br/>
        *Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why? <br/>
        *How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from). <br/>
        *What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip? <br/>
        *Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? <br/>
        *How variable is the utilization by bike ID? <br/>
2. Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring. <br/>
3. Create one of the following visualizations for city officials: <br/>
    * Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top. <br/>
    * Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map. <br/>
    * The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis. <br/>
4. Create your final presentation: <br/>
    * Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards. <br/>
    * Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## **Data**
For my assignment, I have used data publicly available on the [Citi Bike Data webpage](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data). <br/>
   * 202212-citibike-tripdata.csv<br/>
This file is **NOT** in the github due to file size restrictions. <br/>

In this assignment, I receieved assistance through looking at previous activities, stackoverflow, and received some support through my partner who works in the data analyst field<br/>
